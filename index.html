        <h3>Making of the Course Match</h3>
        <h4>8:42 PM</h4>
        <p>I was just watching "The Social Network". And in that, the twins talk to mark about an app he made when he was in high-school, "Course Match". Good Call Mr. Winklevoss. Now, first thing we're gonna need is "The Firebase". Where we can store our Real-time Data. Done. Next thing is, The front-end. A little Atom editor and telling Chat-GPT to make it look Good! Hmm, What color should I go with this time? Red. Done. Next is, The JavaScript Document. I have created a function for execution, which will create an element getting the data from the input. Done. Now I have the Firebase API key and everything. Just telling Chat-GPT to edit the Js document...And Done. Now let's hop into the terminal and start a live server. Done. Hmm, It doesn't seems to work properly. I have an idea, How about we create two different html documents for "sign in" and the "friend's courses". Let's script that to Chat-GPT...And Done. It worked! Now, let's put it into Git-Hub. Done creating  new repo. Done with the Command Prompt. And the files and in... Only thing remaining is to go to the pages and deploy the website. Done! here's the link if you want to see it : https://aadidandekar.github.io/CourseMatch/

I can also show you what it is. Here's the link for the website : https://aadidandekar.github.io/theRuner/. It's called 'the Runer'. Please check it out.</p>

        <p>I need to take my mind off some-things. Easy enough except I need an idea. I am sitting here thinking of creating "Facemach" ;). I am a sociopath and much more, but I am not a psychopath. I am thinking of creating a website.  A lot of investment... But I literally have 0 idea. I had an idea about an App that included Google Maps. But, I don't think think Google will let me. Hmm. What else. Even if I come up with something good, I am sure-as-hell Not gonna blog about it...
